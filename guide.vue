the total score of each player Numbered cards have points as indicated on the
card Jack (J), Queen (Q) and King (K) count as 10 points Ace (A) counts as 11
points Calculate if one of the players has 21 points - Blackjack - with their
initial card, thus winning the round If no one has 21 points, the players must
draw cards from the top of the deck You must stop drawing cards when the score
reaches 17 or higher You lose the game if the score is higher than 21 When you
have stopped drawing cards, Magnus starts drawing cards Magnus stops drawing
cards when his score is higher than your score Magnus loses the game if the
score is higher than 21 The display of the result must contain: Who won the game
